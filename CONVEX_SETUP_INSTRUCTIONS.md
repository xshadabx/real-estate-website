# Convex Setup Instructions

## Current Status
✅ Convex integration code is complete and ready
❌ Convex URL environment variable is missing

## Steps to Fix User Data Storage

### 1. Set up Convex Project
```bash
# Install Convex CLI if not already installed
npm install -g convex

# Initialize Convex in your project
npx convex dev
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-convex-url.convex.cloud
```

### 3. Test the Integration
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Start Convex dev: `npx convex dev`
3. Go to `http://localhost:3001/login`
4. Create a new account
5. Check the home page for the "Convex Connection Test" component
6. Verify user data appears in the Convex dashboard

## What's Already Working
- ✅ Convex schema with users table
- ✅ saveUser mutation in users.ts
- ✅ Frontend integration in LoginForm.tsx
- ✅ Test component to verify connection
- ✅ Error handling and fallback to localStorage

## Expected Behavior
- When users sign up/login, their data should be saved to Convex
- The ConvexTest component should show the number of users in the database
- User data should be visible in the Convex dashboard

## Troubleshooting
If user data is not being stored:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Convex URL is correct in .env.local
3. Ensure Convex dev server is running
4. Check Convex dashboard for any errors
